# ProjectAtmo
Building a gas detection sensor and developing a data analysis pipeline with machine learning to uncover patterns in atmospheric data.

The purpose of this project is to help explore the lifecycle of data. To do this I chose the subject matter of reading atmospheric data and detecting gases. 
By building my own sensing module I will be able to create a data transmission and storage method. Next I will be able to create a data pipeline and begin deeper analysis. The goal is to then create a machine learning algorithm that will be able to learn and detect 'smells'. 

Full cope of hardware and software coming. 

Here I am going to track the progress of this project with periodic updates.
